# Self-supervised-with-object-structure-information


## Description


This project is implementation of self-supervised learning with object structure information. 
  
Our experimental results show that our proposed model has the attention on the holistic objects in both pretext task and classification downstream task. The results also show that the object structure information help the model to get better classification accuracy. We also show our method is generalizable to other computer vision task such as semantic segmentation.


## Get Start


Implementations of image classification are in [classification/](./classification/).

Implementations of semantic segmentation are in [segmentation/](./segmentation/).
